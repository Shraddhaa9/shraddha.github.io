      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a skilled software engineer with a strong background in embedded systems, CarPlay and infotainment development, mobile applications, and system-level debugging. With over 5 years of experience at Picus Tech Software, I bring hands-on expertise in C/C++, Linux kernel tuning, driver porting, and optimized rendering for automotive platforms. I’m currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Illinois Tech and passionate about building efficient, high-quality systems.
